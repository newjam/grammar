Intro

This project contains grammars in the EAG(Extended Affix Grammar) format
for fragments of Spanish.

It is an attempt to formalize the bits of Spanish that I am learning in an attempt to gain a deeper knowledge of the language.
It is not an attempt to formalize all of Spanish, which has been done sufficientl by the field of Corpus Linguistics.
